         <h1>Robust Landmark-Based Audio Fingerprinting</h1>
         <!--introduction-->
         <p>These routines implement a landmark-based audio fingerprinting system that is very well suited to identifying small, noisy
            excerpts from a large number of items.  It is based on the ideas used in the Shazam music matching service, which can identify
            seemingly any commercial music tracks from short snippets recorded via cellphones even in very noisy conditions. I don't know
            if my algorithm is as good as theirs, but the approach, as described in the paper below, certainly seems to work:
         </p>
         <p>Avery Wang "An Industrial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm", Proc. 2003 ISMIR International Symposium on Music Information
            Retrieval, Baltimore, MD, Oct. 2003. <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf">http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf</a></p>
         <p>The basic operation of this scheme is that each audio track is analyzed to find prominent onsets concentrated in frequency,
            since these onsets are most likely to be preserved in noise and distortion.  These onsets are formed into pairs, parameterized
            by the frequencies of the peaks and the time inbetween them.  These values are quantized to give a relatively large number
            of distinct landmark hashes (about 1 million in my implementation). Parameters are tuned to give around 20-50 landmarks per
            second.
         </p>
         <p>Each reference track is described by the (many hundreds) of landmarks it contains, and the times at which they occur.  This
            information is held in an inverted index, which, for each of the 1 million distinct landmarks, lists the tracks in which they
            occur (and when they occur in those tracks).
         </p>
         <p>To identify a query, it is similarly converted to landmarks. Then, the database is queried to find all the reference tracks
            that share landmarks with the queries, and the relative time differences between where they occur in the query and where they
            occur in the reference tracks.  Once a sufficient number of landmarks have been identified as coming from the same reference
            track, with the same relative timing, a match can be confidently declared.  Normally, a small number of matches (e.g. 5) is
            sufficient to declare a match, since chance matches are very unlikely.
         </p>
         <p>The beauty, and robustness, of this approach is that only a few of the maxima (or landmarks) have to be the same in the refererence
            and query examples to allow a match.  If the query example is noisy, or filtered strangely, or truncated, there's still a
            good chance that enough of the hashed landmarks will match to work.  In the examples below, a 5 second excerpt recorded from
            a very low-quality playback is successfully matched.

         <p>The main work in finding the landmarks is done by <a href="find_landmarks.m">find_landmarks</a>.  This contains a number of parameters which can be tuned to control the density of landmarks.  In general, denser landmarks
            result in more robust matching (since there are more opportunities to match), but greater load on the database.
         </p>
         <p>The scheme relies on just a few landmarks being common to both query and reference items.  The greater the density of landmarks,
            the more like this is to occur (meaning that shorter and noisier queries can be tolerated), but the greater the load on the
            database holding the hashes.
         </p>
         <p>The factors influencing the number of landmarks returned are:</p>
         <p>1. The number of local maxima found, which in turn depends on the spreading width applied to the masking skirt from each found
            peak, the decay rate of the masking skirt behind each peak, and the high-pass filter applied to the log-magnitude envelope.
         </p>
         <p>2. The number of landmark pairs made with each peak.  All maxes within a "target region" following the seed max are made into
            pairs, so the larger this region is (in time and frequency), the more maxes there will be.  The target region is defined by
            a freqency half-width, and a time duration.
         </p>
         <p>Landmarks, which are 4-tuples of start time, start frequency, end frequency, and time difference, are converted into hashes
            with a start time and a 20 bit value describing the two frequencies and time difference, by <a href="landmark2hash.m">landmark2hash</a>. <a href="hash2landmark.m">hash2landmark</a> undoes this quantization.
         </p>
         <p>The matching relies on the "inverted index" hash table, implemented by <a href="clear_hashtable.m">clear_hashtable</a>, <a href="save_hashes.m">save_hashes</a>, and <a href="get_hash_hits.m">get_hash_hits</a>. Currently, it's implemented as a single Matlab array, HashTable, stored in a global of 16 x 10^20 uint32s (about 100MB of
            core). This can record just 8 occurrences of each landmark hash, but as the reference database grows, this may fill up.  You
            can change the size it is initialized to in clear_hashtable.m, but really it should be replaced with a real key/value database
            system.

         <p>Other functions included are <a href="add_tracks.m">add_tracks</a>, which simply ties together find_landmarks, landmarks2hash, and save_hashes to enter a new reference track into the database,
